        <h1>Katie</h1>
        <p> Hello, I am Katie Waterston, my background is that I am a school leaver. I finished my A-Levels in 2024.
            The A-Levels I took were Economics, English Language, Business Studies and an AS-Level in Financial Studies. 
            In addition to this, I was the Scrum Master for the group as well as creating the presentation. 
            I found the process of the Scrum Master very interesting and intentive. 
            It allowed me to be able to ensure we were using the correct methods for what suited our team best and ensure the outcome of the website was how we planned it using our wireframes.
            I honestly believe that our planning for our website was the make or break for our website and I can say it was a make!
