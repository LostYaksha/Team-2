                    <p>  What is a Software Developer?
                    <br> A software developer is someone who creates, designs and maintains software applications.
                        They use programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript and many more to build applications for computers, mobile devices and the web.
                        These applications could be things such as games like: Elden Ring, Minecraft, GTA and so on. Or it could be tools used by different
                        careers like in hospitals such as Laerdal which is used to simulate certain scenarios on how to treat patients.

                    <p> Data analysts collect, process and analyse data to help organisations make informed decisions.
                        They use various tools and techniques to interpet data, identify patterns, trends and insight.
                        With these findings, they are presented in a clear and understandable way. Data analysts work with
                        many different types of data such as: sales data, customer data, operational data and so on. 
                        Data Analysts use quite a few tools and programming languages like: Excel, SQL, Python and much more.

                        <p> Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage. It involves using tools, 
                            techniques, and best practices to safeguard sensitive information from hackers, malware, and other cyber threats. Key areas include network security, 
                            data encryption, ethical hacking, and security awareness. For beginners, learning cybersecurity means understanding how to secure devices, recognize online threats, 
                            and follow safe practices to prevent cyberattacks.

                    <p>  IT Support and Administration is all about making sure computers, softwares and networks work properly in a Business or organisation.
                        IT Support roles are more focused on helping people that have problems when it comes to their devices. These can include people having
                        problems with their internet connection, maybe their phone or laptop isn't turning on, they're having issues accessing certain apps like emails 
                        or webpages. IT Supporters are focusing more on "help-desk" roles or troubleshooting for others.
                        IT Administrations focus more on keeping computer systems running smoothly by setting networks, managing accounts and their privileges as well as ensuring
                        security on those networks and devices. They normally tend to work in topologys (a network of devices connected to a switch or central hub, normally a server, and how data is passed throughout
                        each device) and allow all nodes (devices in the topology, primarily computers) to function well and have all their privileges aligned with the roles and purposes each node has been given.

                    <h1 class="resource-title"> Cloud Computing & DevOps </h1>
                    <p> Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services. This includes: servers, storage, databases, networking, 
                        software and analytics over the internet. The term "cloud" simply refers to a network of remote servers accessed over the internet 
                        that store, manage and process data instead of using a local computer or on-premises server. Simply put, it is just someone else's 
                        computer that you access online which you can use to perform certain tasks like storing files, running apps or performing tasks.
                        Examples of these would be: Google drive, dropbox and Netflix are clouds and all rely on cloud infrastructure.
                        DevOps is a set of practices, cultural philosophies and tools that aim to improve collaberations between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams.
                        It's primary focus is on automation (this allows for repetitive tasks to be done automatically) continuous integration (which is allowing new things to be tested and implemented as soon as possible with the highest quality possible)
                        Continuous Deployment (which allows these new things to be continuously implemented and added without needing things to close, slow down or manually update)
                        This allows for better monitoring to enhance software delivery speed, reliability and efficiency.
                        Although cloud computing and devops seem to be separate things, they are primarily used together for more  efficiency and speed.

                    <h1 class="resource-title"> Networking & Infrastructure </h1> 
                    <p>  Networking is how computers and devices communicate with each other. Networks are made using different kinds of toplogy's
                        (a topology is just a network of nodes (devices) that is connected to a switch or central hub, such as a main server.) This is 
                        done so there is an organised system that allows for network traffic and packets to travel smoothly around the topology without any issues.
                        The infrastructure is just the physical and digital "backbone" that supports the IT system. Objectives can be to make sure all the wiring across
                        the topology is well fitted and works well, allowing the data to be transmitted smoothly. Another role can be for permissions to be set on each node 
                        and making sure that each device has the correct permissions and one won't have more or less than they should.

                    <p> There are a lot of different avenues you can take when it comes to IT Projects & Business Roles:
                        Project Mangers (Plan, track and manage everything going on as well as ensuring project stays on time, budget and meets goals.)
                        Business Analyst (Talks to people affected by projects to understand requirements.)
                        Ofcourse there are the developers that build the project by writing code, developing the software, website or app used.
                        Quality assurance testers test the software before launching, they look for bugs, errors and performance issues. 
                        Each role and every individual plays a major part in creating projects for whoever it may be for, most roles in technology will be 
                        implemented in these projects.

                    <p> ChatGPT or any Gen AI is good to be used as a tool, as long as you don't just copy whatever is presented to you verbatim.
                        As Gen AI tools (albeit can be quite resourceful, often get larger projects and things wrong which could lead to more hassle than good.)
                    <br> <br>
                        Another tip is to always search for things that you're unsure of, almost anything tech related is primarily figuring out how to do stuff
                        and finding resources to help you accomplish those goals online.</p>
