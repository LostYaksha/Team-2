    <h5> Cloud Computing & DevOps </h5>
    <p> Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services. This includes: servers, storage, databases, networking, 
        software and analytics over the internet. The term "cloud" simply refers to a network of remote servers accessed over the internet 
        that store, manage and process data instead of using a local computer or on-premises server. Simply put, it is just someone else's 
        computer that you access online which you can use to perform certain tasks like storing files, running apps or performing tasks.
        Examples of these would be: Google drive, dropbox and Netflix are clouds and all rely on cloud infrastructure.

    <h6> Top tips from us!</h6>
    <p> ChatGPT or any Gen AI is good to be used as a tool, as long as you don't just copy whatever is presented to you verbatim.
         As Gen AI tools (albeit can be quite resourceful, often get larger projects and things wrong which could lead to more hassle than good.)
    <br> <br>
        Another tip is to always search for things that you're unsure of, almost anything tech related is primarily figuring out how to do stuff
         and finding resources to help you accomplish those goals online.</p>
